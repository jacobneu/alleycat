\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda x.x+2$ is a function $\N\to\N$, taking a natural number $n$ to $n+2$
    \item $\lambda x.x+2$ can also be regarded as a function $\Z\to\Z$, where $\Z$ is the set of all integers
    \item $\lambda x.\ITE{x>0}{1}{-1}$ is a function $\Z\to\set{1,-1}$ which sends all positive integers to 1 and all other integers (negative and zero) to $-1$
\end{itemize}
